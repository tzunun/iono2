Project based on a paper that analyzed 
				OLR outgoing earth radiation
								(infra-red 10-13micro m)
				GPS/TEC
								Ionospheric variability
				Thermodynamics properties in the lower atmosphere
								Ambient temperature and relative humidity
												multiyear day-by-day counts of nighttime temperatures
												used to compute daily temperature varialtions near the vecinity
												of the earthquake
												current value and the multiyear mean of air temperature
												variability. Identify when the max tends to occur prior to
												earthquake.
Earthquake dates
				April 25
				May 12

				OLR
								April 21-22
								May 3-4
				GPS/TEC
								April 21
												Negative and positive anomalies
								April 24 
								
				Temperature/Humidity
								Four years nighttime temp data to obtain average change

				Space Weather has to be taken into account in order to not affect the
				calculations.

Differential GIM maps have to be build to show the anomalies
				Analyze Delta Tec variations of the earthquake periods
