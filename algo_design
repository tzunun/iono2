Tec anomaly size of area changes with earthquake magniture

Anomalies appear 3 days prior and are 55% higher(different) relative

Increases and decreases located in the vecinity of the forthcomming
earthquake epicenter. Changes generated in the ionosphere for several days prior to the shock

Plasma reduced by orders of maginitud (factor of 10) related to normal conditions.

** Possible changes could be augmented by multiplying the delta by 100 or higher similar
to the technicque used by Andrew Ng to measure bloodflow and heart rate from videos.

Changes usually manifest in an area as wide as 1500km latitud, 3500km Longitud.
