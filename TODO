TODO for the IONO project

 * Scrape the data (Download the data)

* Parse Rinex to something easily stored

save the data to a database

Dash board design

*Dash build Skeleton

Pytorch for deeplearning to train models
				AutoML from H20

* Save map data so it can be loaded and read from the flask app.
				Map can easily be modified by data


sunrise and sunset provided by weather api, data has to be saved as to not make requests of the same data


################ Dash ##########################

*When in fullscreen mode the TEC map is not proportional

*The selector should be either Date and choose either Earquake TEC map obviously the 
earthquake lat, lon have to be plotted on the same map.
Or choose TEC map with different hours.  The issue is calculating what hour to display for the
TEC map that show earthquake.


Map has to show current TEC for the earthquake as well as the new TEC map used by
averaging out the data from previous days, years.  Same for temperature.  Maybe display
a regular graph. Bar graph showing the difference.

##### Create dropdown with a list of earthquakes for that day.  Open a new page
diplay information related.  To that earthquake.  
Historical temps
changes in TEC
	Historical
	within the  previous 10 days or so.
OLR data
	Historical
	Within 10 previous days.

#### This is a single page app.  Review designing singple page apps
