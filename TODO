Terminator time must be calculated locally, 
	Find out what time is being used to write the reports,
	is it UTC?  Most likely since it expands to other Global Posicioning satellite systems

	Possibly calculate it based on Lat, Long and add the time to the database.
	if calculations proves time consuming then use the weather data api to get 
	the information.

sunrise and sunset provided by weather api, data has to be saved as to not make requests of the same data
