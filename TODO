TODO for the IONO project

 * Scrape the data (Download the data)

Parse Rinex to something easily stored

save the data to a database

Dash board design

Dash build Skeleton

Pytorch for deeplearning to train models
				AutoML from H20

* Save map data so it can be loaded and read from the flask app.
				Map can easily be modified by data

Terminator time must be calculated locally, 
	Find out what time is being used to write the reports,
	is it UTC?  Most likely since it expands to other Global Posicioning satellite systems

	Possibly calculate it based on Lat, Long and add the time to the database.
	if calculations proves time consuming then use the weather data api to get 
	the information.

sunrise and sunset provided by weather api, data has to be saved as to not make requests of the same data

  87.5-180.0 180.0   5.0 450.0                            LAT/LON1/LON2/DLON/H

When in fullscreen mode the TEC map is not proportional

The selector should be either Date and choose either Earquake TEC map obviously the 
earthquake lat, lon have to be plotted on the same map.
Or choose TEC map with different hours.  The issue is calculating what hour to display for the
TEC map that show earthquake.


Map has to show current TEC for the earthquake as well as the new TEC map used by
averaging out the data from previous days, years.  Same for temperature.  Maybe display
a regular graph. Bar graph showing the difference.
